ibus-skk -- a Japanese input engine for IBus.

*NOTE* This engine is not usable by now.  It has still a lot of bugs
and lacks essentital features such as user dictionary support.

How to use:

$ sudo apt-get install skkdic
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
$ sudo make install
<kill ibus-daemon>
$ ibus-daemon --verbose
