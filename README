ibus-skk -- a Japanese input engine for IBus.

*NOTE* This engine is not usable by now.  It has still a lot of bugs
and lacks essentital features such as user dictionary support.

How to use:

$ apt-get install skkdic
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
$ sudo make install
<kill ibus-daemon>
$ ibus-daemon --verbose

The implementation is based on ibus-tmpl and ibus-anthy.  The icon in
icons/ibus-skk.png was grabbed from SCIM-SKK.  Translation tables are
taken from SKK.
