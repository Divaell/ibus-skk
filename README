ibus-skk -- a Japanese input engine for IBus.

*NOTE* This engine is not usable by now.  It has still a lot of bugs
and lacks essentital features such as user dictionary support.

How to use:

$ sudo apt-get install skkdic
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
$ sudo make install
$ /usr/bin/ibus-setup # run ibus
$ GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus gedit
